<h4>
The Schism - Platform Manifest
</h4>
You should know the drill of course... :) If you don't please checkout some guides on building and syncing from Git sources
I would recommened you to checkout the OmniRom wiki or Cyanogenmod Wiki as they are loaded with informations for compiling and starting a Linux compiling environment. ;) 

Commands to input after your "schism" directory is made and you are in the directory in Terminal

$ repo init -u git://github.com/TheSchismROM/platform_manifest.git -b kk-4.4

$ repo sync -j4

You may change the "4" to a higher number if your internet is really really fast and your computer is boss but "4" is a common number for most people.

If you would like to help us and contribute to our code, please either contact me on xda (moneyolo) or Dean Jordan on Google+ or you can also fork our repositories and send in pull requests and we will happily merge them in if they are found worthy of merging. Thank you!!
