You know the drill of course. :) Well you should..if not, you might want to look up a guide to build and sync from sources.

$ repo init -u git://github.com/TheSchismROM/platform_manifest.git -b kk-4.4

$ repo sync -j4

You may change the "4" if your internet is really really fast and your computer is boss.

If you would like to help us and contribute to our code, please do either by pull requests or even contact me with the changed files and we will see if we can merge it into our sources. Thank you.
